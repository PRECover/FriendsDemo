# FriendsDemo

A mini technical (just for fun) project to impress with my skills. Let me show the final version.
Friendly launch screen :)

First of you see in this app - empty screen with title "Friends" and search button in navigation bar. It mean, you haven't friends (in app, of course). But just tap search button in top right of screen and you will see something like this:

Thanks https://randomuser.me/ for this users list! Now, just choose the people that you like and return to "Friends" screen.

Here is it! Now you have some people in friends list. You can delete peoples by using swipe-to-left. And you can tap cell for seeing detail information. You can edit it if you want.
